## 01. Problem statement
Due to climate change, we are experiencing more droughts, which are having an impact on nature and our scarce water supply. Every year we are seeing more and more news articles that the situation is becoming more problematic.

In general, we see 3 problems with the current water management policy:

1. Current measurements taken are all centralized and focused on prohibitions, which are difficult to enforce in practice.

2. People are not incentivizedÂ to be more frugal with water, especially during droughts, as the price is always stable with no penalty for irresponsible consumers. While people who take the water shortages seriously by changing their way of consumption are not rewarded.
     
3. Although more and more news articles are published, the problem is still under recognized. If any, it is only becoming worse instead of better.

We have come up with Hydroblox, a blockchain based solution, which should tackle the above problems in a cost-effective decentralized scalable way.
